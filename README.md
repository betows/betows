## 🧩 Philosophy

> “Anyone can learn to code. What companies want is someone who **understands the system**, sees where to act, and delivers.”

I wrote an ebook called **"What They Expect"** to help developers understand that coding is only part of the game – knowing how to integrate, debug, and reason through architecture is what matters.
